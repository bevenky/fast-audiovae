# Supertonic Training Pipeline

Reverse-engineered training and inference code for SupertonicTTS
(paper: arXiv 2503.23108), built from the released ONNX models and the paper.

This is not an official Supertone repository. No shipped weights are
redistributed here. The original model, paper, and released assets belong to
Supertone.

## Current Local Status

As of 2026-05-13, this workspace has completed a KSS single-speaker
paper-faithful reproduction run.

Completed artifacts:

```text
AE : training/runs/ae_paper_audit_crop1s_mean/ckpt_step01500000.pt
TTL: training/runs/ttl_paper_rope_b32a2/ckpt_step00700000.pt
DP : training/runs/dp_paper_rope_3k/ckpt_step00003000.pt
```

The final stack produces intelligible Korean single-speaker TTS. Six manual
test sentences were synthesized with `cfg_scale=1.0`, `steps=16`, and
DP-predicted duration; all produced valid unclipped waveforms and were judged
to have correct pronunciation.

## Key Result

The earlier "babbling" output was not primarily an AE ceiling. It was a
text-to-latent alignment failure caused by Stage 2 implementation drift.

Most important fix:

- `LARoPETextCrossAttention.theta` must be initialized for from-scratch
  training using the same formula as the released ONNX graph:
  `theta = 10 * 10000^(-j / half)`.

Leaving this buffer effectively zero removed useful text-position information
from vector-field cross-attention and caused severe pronunciation failure.
After the theta fix, RoPE self-attention, and effective batch 64, the TTL+DP
stack learned usable Korean pronunciation.

## What This Repo Contains

Two layers are maintained:

1. `analysis/`
   PyTorch reimplementations of the released ONNX inference modules:
   `duration_predictor`, `text_encoder`, `vector_estimator`, and `vocoder`.
   These are used both for verification and as the training-time forward
   modules where appropriate.

2. `training/`
   Three-stage training code:
   AE-GAN -> TTL flow matching -> DP duration prediction.

See `training/README.md` for the detailed stage-by-stage recipe and local run
notes.

## Scope And Limits

The architecture and training recipe are implemented to match the paper where
the paper is explicit. This does not mean the local KSS run matches the paper's
zero-shot setting.

The paper used much larger data:

- AE: 11,167 hours, about 14,000 speakers.
- TTL/DP: 945 hours, about 2,576 speakers.

The local run uses:

- KSS: 12.86 hours, 1 Korean female speaker.
- One RTX 3090.

Therefore:

- KSS single-speaker TTS is now working.
- Zero-shot voice cloning still requires multi-speaker AE + TTL + DP training.
- KSS-only training cannot teach the model to use reference speaker variation.

## Paper-Faithful Definition Used Here

**Important: this targets the 44 M baseline described in the paper text, not the
65–66 M variant shipped on Hugging Face.** Both share the same architecture; the
shipped release uses 2× wider hidden dimensions for the text-to-latent module.

| Module | Paper text (this repo, default) | Shipped Hugging Face ONNX |
|---|---|---|
| TextEncoder dim | 128 | 256 (4× params) |
| VectorField dim | 256 | 512 (4× params) |
| **TTL (TE+SE+VF) params** | **~19 M** | **~40 M** |
| Vocoder (= AE decoder) | 25.3 M | 25.3 M |
| DP | 0.5 M | 0.3 M |
| **Total inference params** | **~45 M** (paper Table 5: 44 M) | **~66 M** |

The paper text describes the 44 M baseline (Sec A.2.1 / A.2.2 / A.2.3 give the
exact `dim=128` / `dim=256` numbers). The released ONNX uses wider dims that the
paper does not enumerate. Both code paths are supported:

- `train_ttl.py` defaults → **paper 44 M** baseline (`TextEncoderPaper`,
  `StyleEncoderTTLPaper`, `VectorField(dim=256, ...)`).
- `train_ttl.py --shipped_dim` or `--fine_tune` → shipped 66 M variant
  (`TextEncoder` dim 256, `VectorField` default dim 512).

The current Stage 2 TTL training matches the paper baseline:

- TextEncoderPaper: dim 128, RoPE self-attention (paper A.2.2 line 1075).
- StyleEncoderTTLPaper: 50 style tokens, value dim 128, output scale 1.0.
- VectorField: dim 256, latent dim 144, `K_e=4`.
- TextEncoder and VectorField share the same 50x128 reference key.
- Flow matching uses `sigma_min=1e-8`.
- Classifier-free dropout is one joint Bernoulli event, `p_uncond=0.05`.
- Reference crop is 0.2s to 9s and no more than half the utterance.
- Flow loss mask excludes the reference crop region.
- AdamW uses lr `5e-4`, halved every 300k TTL updates.
- Single-3090 effective batch is 64 via `batch_size=32` and `grad_accum=2`.

To verify the param count locally: `python -m training.scripts.count_params`.

Known paper ambiguities or unavoidable differences:

- The paper does not publish the official training code.
- RoPE convention is not specified down to implementation details.
- AE multi-resolution reconstruction reduction is ambiguous; this repo uses
  mean-scale reduction after audit.
- DP estimator dimensions in the paper text are internally inconsistent; the
  default follows the released ONNX/deployed 192-dim estimator shape while using
  paper RoPE and paper style encoder scaling.
- Data, speaker count, language distribution, and GPU scale differ heavily from
  the paper.

## Notes On Fine-Tuning Shipped Weights

Older README versions described a shipped-weight fine-tune path. That path is
still useful for experiments, but it is not the current paper-faithful KSS
from-scratch path.

The current priorities are:

1. Keep the successful KSS single-speaker run reproducible.
2. Preserve the LARoPE theta initialization fix.
3. Decide whether the next milestone is audio-quality improvement,
   multi-speaker data, or Supertonic 3 asset support.
